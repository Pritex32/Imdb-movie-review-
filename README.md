# Imdb-movie-review-

## Objective:
#### Develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment.

## Key Steps Taken:
#### Data Preprocessing:

- Tokenized text using nltk.word_tokenize().
- Removed unnecessary characters using re (Regular Expressions).
- Used PorterStemmer for stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
- Removed stop words (words that don’t add meaningful value to text).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualized sentiment distribution using Seaborn’s bar plot.
## Model building:

- Feature extraction using Count vectorizer.
- Train a classification model  Naïve Bayes, knn).
- Evaluate accuracy and performance metrics (confusion_matrix).
## Importance of this project
- it enable easy analysis of the reviews
- It will enable the company to detect movies customers love alot
